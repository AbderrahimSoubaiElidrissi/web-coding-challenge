# Web Coding Challenge

The [coding challenge](coding-challenge.md) is optional if you already have some code that you're proud of and can share with us.

Coding Challenge Specs

[Specs can be found here.](coding-challenge.md)

How we review
----------------

Your application will be reviewed by at least three of our engineers. We do take into consideration your experience level.

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

* **Architecture**: how clean is the separation between the front-end and the back-end?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
